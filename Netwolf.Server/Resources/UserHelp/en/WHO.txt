WHO <channel|nick|mask> [flags][%format[,token]] [mask]

The WHO command allows you to search users and display information on them.
It can be executed on a channel to display that channel's members, a nickname
to display information for that nick only, or a mask that can optionally
contain * and ? wildcards to show users who match that mask according to the
specified flags.

If a mask is specified as the third parameter, the first parameter is ignored
unless it is a channel, in which case only users on the channel who also match
the mask are displayed. Specifying the mask in the third parameter allows you
to add spaces into the mask, which may be helpful when matching realnames. It
also allows you to match other user information even if the mask happens to be
a nickname that is currently on the network, unlike a mask in the first
parameter.

If the first parameter is a channel name, all users on the channel will be
listed if you are also on that channel. If you are not on the channel, users
will only be listed if the channel is not have the +s (secret) channel mode set
and the user does not have the +i (invisible) user mode set.

If the first parameter is a literal 0 or *, a global search is executed.

{{#oper:spy:who}}
The first parameter may be prefixed with the ! character to perform an operspy.
If this is done, you will be shown all information about the target channel or 
mask, even if the channel is +s or the user is +i. Other opers will be notified
when performing an operspy. Requires privilege oper:spy:who.
{{/oper:spy:who}}

Flags may optionally be specified in the second parameter to control what data
that a mask searches against or to limit the results in other fashions. If no
flags are specified, the mask will search against the user's nickname,
username, hostname, and realname. IP address searches support CIDR formatting.

+------+----------------------------+
| Flag | Description                |
+------+----------------------------+
|    n | Search nicknames           |
|    u | Search usernames           |
|    h | Search hostnames           |
|    r | Search realnames           |
|    a | Search account names       |
|    i | Search IP addresses        |
|    o | Display only IRC operators |

If no %format is specified, the response will be 0 or more RPL_WHOREPLY (352)
numerics followed by RPL_ENDOFWHO (315). Each reply consists of the following
fields, in order:

1. If a channel was specified in the first parameter, that channel. Otherwise,
   an arbitrary channel the client is joined to, or "*" if the client is not
   joined to any channels.
2. The user's username.
3. The user's hostname.
4. The server name. As Netwolf has no concept of multiple linked servers, this
   will always be a static value.
5. The user's nickname.
6. The user's status, which consists of the following characters in order:
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Status | Description                                    |
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   |      H | The user is not away                           |
   |      G | The user is away                               |
   |      O | ^The user is offline                           |
   |      M | ^The user is connected from a mobile device;   |
   |        |  shown instead of 'H' if applicable            |
   |      * | The user is an IRC operator                    |
   |      & | The user is an admin of the channel in field 1 |
   |      @ | The user is an op of the channel in field 1    |
   |      % | The user is a halfop of the channel in field 1 |
   |      + | The user is voiced in the channel in field 1   |
   |      B | The user is a bot                              |
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   A ^ denotes that this value is only exposed if the client has negotiated the
   netwolf.org/presence vendor CAP.
7. The user's hop count followed by the user's realname. As Netwolf has no
   concept of multiple linked servers, the hop count will always be 0.

If a %format is specified, the response will be 0 or more RPL_WHOSPCRPL (354)
numerics followed by RPL_ENDOFWHO (315). The reply will vary based on the
format provided; the following format characters are supported. The ordering of
format characters sent by the client is ignored; responses will always follow
the order specified in the following table.
